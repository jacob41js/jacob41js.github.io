            <h2>Personal Reflections</h2>
            <p>After spending so much time reading about such dreary subjects as the life of prisoners and exile in Tsarist Russia, this was a nice antidote to refresh my reading appetite. The more Vonnegut I read the more I notice his meta-personality, Kilgore Trout, strung throughout his novels like a multidimensional plot device wrangled into being by a humorous Christopher Nolan. Galapagos tells the story of the last human beings on earth who, through a series of coincidental events during an undescribed apocalypse at the very moment the world economy is melting down, are spared by getting away from the mainland of Guayaquil, Ecuador and eventually making landfall on the Galapagos island of Santa Rosalita. The eclectic (to say the least) cast of characters that eventually constitute the only surviving branch of humanity assembled in Ecuador to begin with to take the “nature cruise of the century”, and include a school teacher whose husband died of cancer but wanted her to take the cruise without him (another meta point is that this couple is from Ilium, NY, setting for the last Vonnegut novel I read, Player Piano, which makes it seem like that novel either happened in a parallel universe or things didn’t end up quite so bad after the rebellion that ended that story); a Japanese inventor of an artificial intelligence handheld device and his pregnant wife (pregnant with a very furry human, the cause of which, I suppose, is the nuclear fallout she was exposed to as a child during the atomic bombing of Hiroshima); his artificial intelligence machine, the Mandarax; the American business man who invited him on the cruise to try to woo him away from Japan to make invent products for his company, plus his blind daughter; a con artist who makes a living by swindling rich widows, marrying them, then killing them off for the money; and the ship’s captain who apparently knows absolutely nothing about sailing. Oh, we also have the narrator, the ghost son of Kilgore Trout who haunts the ship carrying these passengers after he was killed by being guillotined by a sheet of metal while working on the ship in Sweden. He has the opportunity to pass into the afterlife but declines, and as punishment he is imprisoned on earth for one million years. The narrative of the story takes place from the perspective, then, of this ghost telling us what happened one million years ago.</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t rank this as a great Vonnegut novel. It struck me as trying a little too hard to make a point about contemporary politics (it was written and set in the ‘80s). He also never gives you a very clear picture of what humanity ended up as, even though there are strong indications that we become something akin to seal, or what exactly was the apocalypse that wiped out humanity as we know it. There’s nothing particularly wrong with this approach, but I also am not sure what it accomplished. Much of the novel is a polemic against corporate greed, and in that way it reminded me of a science fictionalized Wall Street. I suppose we are supposed to assume that it was our avaricious nature that led us to become too big for our breeches, which in turn caused the earth to fight back and wipe us out. Or maybe it was a nuclear holocaust. We don’t really know what happened. But that’s a pretty timeless thesis that fell slightly on deaf ears for me. It’s not that I don’t see that capability in humanity, but it’s more that the self-correcting function embedded within our species seems to be a bit stronger than people typically assume. Perhaps I’m naïve in that way. Certainly things can and do go wrong, but we’ve yet to annihilate ourselves despite the ability to do so. That I think speaks not just to good luck but to some kind of skill or ability that authors of books like this don’t account for. Who knows, to get even more meta, maybe it’s precisely because of authors of books like these that we haven’t destroyed ourselves. Maybe people like Kurt Vonnegut are our Cassandras who can alert just enough people to looming issues that people care enough to make tiny adjustments or innovations that ward off each subsequent potential disaster. Vonnegut apparently does care about humanity, even though his humor and purported outlook are black and bleak. But I don’t think he was under any illusions that he would be changing people’s minds with this book. In fact there’s a lengthy thread towards the end of the book where the narrator is describing how he finally met someone who had read his father’s books and had been deeply moved by them. Is that how Vonnegut saw himself? If so, I think goes to show how solutions to our problems might come from completely unexpected or unimagined places, places even beyond the reach of science fiction writers like Kilgore Trout.</p>
