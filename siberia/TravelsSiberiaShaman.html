            <h2>Personal Reflections</h2>
            <p>2025 is the year of Siberia. In December I listened to an episode of Conversations with Tyler featuring Stephen Kotkin which rabbit holed into a long discussion about Siberia. Stephenâ€™s take on the region left me with a bout of wanderlust, even though, realistically, I know this is a place I will never personally get to experience. Not merely faraway, Siberia is remote from the nearest faraway place, and in my ignorant mind a complete cipher, tucked into the tundra of the Artic and straddling the Eurasian steppe. Listening to him speak I was baffled at the fact that I had never before given more than a glancing thought to a swath of land that accounts for more than 10% of all terrain on earth, encompasses 12 time zones, and nearly reaches out and touches Alaska across the Bering Strait. Not only that, but I have my own, overly romanticized love affair with Russian literature, and, to a lesser degree, culture. But through all my readings of Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Turgenev, and Solzhenitsyn, the idea of Siberia never conjured more than a hazy notion, a physical symbol of the shear massiveness of Russia and the many depths it held. Even if I wouldnâ€™t be able to see it with my own eyes, what mysteries could I uncover by reading a slate of books devoted to this leviathan of earth?</p>
            <p>I fired up Abebooks and placed the largest order, quantity-wise, for books Iâ€™ve ever made. This reading list was partially given by talking with LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT) and partly by scrolling around the â€˜Customers Also Boughtâ€™ section of Amazon. In the end the list looked like this:</p>
            <p>â€¢	Travels in Siberia â€“ Ian Frazier (Audiobook)</p>
            <p>â€¢	Siberia: A History of the People â€“ Janet M. Hartley</p>
            <p>â€¢	The Shamanâ€™s Coat â€“ Anna Reid</p>
            <p>â€¢	Landscapes of the Imagination: Siberia â€“</p> 
            <p>â€¢	The Great Soul of Siberia â€“ Sooyong Park</p>
            <p>â€¢	The Reindeer People â€“ Piers Vitebsky</p>
            <p>â€¢	The House of the Dead â€“ Daniel Beer</p> 
            <p>â€¢	Stalinâ€™s Meteorologist â€“ Olivier Rolin</p> 
            <p>â€¢	The Gulag Archipelago â€“ Alexandr Solzhenitsyn</p> 
            <p>The rough plan of my reading journey is:</p> 
            <p>1.	Understand broadly the geography of Siberia, the peoples who live there, and the basic history of the region â€“ Russian and native (first four books)</p>
            <p>2.	Understand more deeply about the ecology, geology, and climate of the region (fifth and sixth books)</p>
            <p>3.	Understand how Siberia was used as a place of exile throughout the course of Russian history (last three books)</p>
            <p>This plan will probably be supplemented along the way with additional books cited by the books I currently have, but at least itâ€™s a starting place. I began with Frazierâ€™s Travels in Siberia as an easy audiobook entrÃ©e into the subject and casually listened to it for itâ€™s roughly 20 hour runtime over three or four weeks. Written in the early 2000s, itâ€™s a bit dated now given how the political situation in Russia has changed in the last decade, but it gives a great introduction to Siberia. Generally the book follows Frazierâ€™s visits to Russia (which has a distinct Russia smell, apparently) and Siberia over roughly 20 years, from making a quick jaunt from Alaska to Chukotka in a puddle jumper run by a guy who only flies that route, to his two cross-subcontinent road trips, one during the summer (whose end coincided with the 9/11 attacks) and one during the winter so that he could really experience the extremes of Siberia. Not knowing the geography or really anything about Siberia going into the book, I was essentially along for the ride with nothing sticking with me about the region itself aside from some broad generalizations â€“ Lake Baikal is stunningly beautiful, Irkutsk is the Paris of Siberia, Chukotka is very close to Alaska and has extremely forbidding seas and weather, Russians arenâ€™t particularly keen about showing foreigners the prisons and gulags that once dotted the Siberian landscape like a pockmarked smallpox case. Also, Russians are great mechanics in a pinch.</p> 
            <p>It was sometimes hard to disentangle Frazierâ€™s feelings about life and what was happening in the narrative. Granted, this was a travel memoir, and his references to George Kennanâ€™s travels across Siberia reveal that he had that in mind while undertaking this project. And maybe, as a fellow American who knows nothing beside my creature comforts, because it was easier to relate to him than to the factual Siberia, what rang most true to me in the book were the passages where he encountered the brutal reality of life in Siberia â€“ how remote it was and how difficult it was to make your way across it (he had a satellite phone to check in with his family); how semi-lawless it could be, like when they had to disguise their van as part of the Russian equivalent of the Red Cross once they made past a certain point on the road; how they smelled like a rotten baby from all the dairy products they ate on a daily basis since that was really all that was available; and how poor the inhabitants were, evidenced by their glee at receiving a Beanie Baby or a souvenir New York snow globe from Frazier.</p> 
            <p>There was a good bit about the history of Russia under the rule of Genghis Khan. His reign of terror in old Muscovy, Frazier makes the case, left an indelible scar on the psyche of the Russian people that to this day affects their personalities and view of the world. He weaves in a good bit about the crows in Russia even being affected by this history, because there, as compared to the crows in America, the birds seem to be languidly awaiting the next slaughter when theyâ€™ll be able to feast, unchecked, yet again. Frazier might have a point about the Mongols, though. Itâ€™s easy to imagine the horrors they inflicted sticking in the cultural memory and acting as an unseen motivation behind their drive for empire once the Romanov line began and Russia began to see itself as the â€˜new Romeâ€™ for Christianity. Throughout the colonial period (if thatâ€™s an appropriate name to give to the era during which Siberia was settled by Russianâ€™s) they required the payment of a yasak from the native Siberia tribes they had â€˜conqueredâ€™. Yasak was the Mongolian word for the tribute Genghis imposed on the peoples he brought into his empire. In Siberia early on, this was often paid in the form of sable pelts, since in the 16th and 17th century this fur was once of the most precious commodities in the Russian empire, and more broadly into Europe.</p> 
            <p>At this point Hartleyâ€™s book does well explaining in some depth and detail the building of Siberia by the Russians into a true part of the empire, as opposed to the terra incognita beyond the Urals it had been until the 16th century. Though dry as the midwinter air in the Siberian tundra, I couldnâ€™t help simply being thankful that a book like this can exist. Hereâ€™s what I mean. What becomes very clear in reading her book is not only the terrible vastness of Siberia, but also every personâ€™s helplessness in the face of it until about 100 years ago. You end up asking the question again and again, just how do people make their way around such an enormous part of the globe without the benefit of modern technology like maps, automobiles, and communication technologies? I think Iâ€™m doing a poor job at explaining this phenomenon, but maybe Iâ€™ll just say this â€“ while reading Hartleyâ€™s book I referred again and again to the inset maps she included in each chapter to help orient myself when the place-names all started running together, but the first Siberian settlers had nothing approaching this aide, and, by and large, itâ€™s hard to imagine that, aside from the actual explorers who made the maps, any of the inhabitants had a true grasp of what else was out there beyond, perhaps a 50 mile radius from their little Siberian village. Iâ€™d bet if I set out from my house today without a map, phone, or automobile â€“ let alone the benefit of grocery stores that Iâ€™d inevitably run into â€“ Iâ€™d be about dead of starvation as quickly as possible. But because of this incredible time that we live in, Hartley can travel around Siberia conducting research knowing exactly where she is and where sheâ€™s headed next, and I can read a book about the history of a place that should otherwise be uninhabitable from the comfort of my own home, consulting with the internet on anything that needs clarification. I take this as an unadulterated boon of progress, but I suppose others may not think so. And one addendum to add here is that this applies to written history, as well. Western European history spoils us because there is so much written down from a relatively early period of time, but it seems that the history of the native peoples in Siberia is largely invisible, except for when more literate societies occasionally dip into its story, like the ancient Chinese and Mongols. </p>
            <p>Reidâ€™s book is further proof of this last point. Ostensibly a book in search of any remaining shamans in modern Russia, it dwells more on the history of the native tribes of Siberia â€“ the Khant, Tuva, Buryat, Chukchi, Nivkh, Sakha, and others â€“ and the effect Russian history has had on them. However, enlightening as it is, it appears to be the case that prior to Ermakâ€™s invasion of western Siberia in the 16th century, all we have is a pinprick of light against a cloudy night sky as we try to uncover the life of these peoples in the likely thousands of years prior they inhabited this place. I suppose the implication most people make is that until that epoch things in Siberia were largely always the same â€“ herding reindeer, fishing, making homes, practicing an animistic religion, etc. But that canâ€™t be entirely true. Surely the history of Siberian natives is as tangled and bloody and fascinating as that of any other people throughout history, filled with heroes and villains, cultural milestones and discoveries, the rising and falling of empires â€“ weâ€™ll just never know it. </p>
            <p>Reidâ€™s prose has an artistry to it that neither Frazier nor Hartley had â€“ although Frazier certainly had a style of his own â€“ that floats you through the narrative like the spring thaw of the frozen rivers of the taiga. She also has a depth of knowledge that allows her to make comparisons across history and draw out arguments about the state of things in Siberian Russia today. There are reflections about the ebb of Buddhist belief after perestroika, how at first people came flooding back to the religion only to trickle away again when the allures of modernity and the dissolution of old traditions were fully realized. She smartly identifies the lack of white guilt in Russian Siberians with respect to their native neighbors as being rooted in the usually dreadful circumstances under which most of their parents and grandparents were brought to Siberia in the first place. She notes the rising cosmopolitan consciousness of Siberian shamans in the early 20th century as they began to become concerned with issues that are familiar today â€“ environmental degradation, colonialism, industrialization, the general debasement of the human person with the goal of elevating the standard of living for humanity (or at least a subset of it).</p>
            <p>While Hartleyâ€™s depiction of the facts of living in a Siberian settlement as Russiaâ€™s empire grew across Asia was illuminating, Reid goes a far way towards showing us why that still matters. Siberia was part penal colony, part nationalistic hubris, part a genuine hope for people crushed beneath the rigid system of serfdom in European Russia, and thatâ€™s all still relevant today. And beyond that, it may be a place that is too big to be conquered. How, truly, does a tsar or any autocrat effectively rule such an enormous mass of land when communication channels are virtually prehistoric and the place is barely understood? Moving towards the 20th century an enormous portion of the population was comprised of exiles, women were grossly outnumbered by men, native populations were in decline, and sables had been hunted to near extinction. Perhaps it isnâ€™t much different than colonial regimes the world over, but the people who ended up in Siberia very often had no incentive to make the place better â€“ they had no agency, there was no point in trying. Power was reserved for a ruler thousands of miles away whether you were a peasant, a prisoner, or a native. And the local military governor was often unchecked in his ability to take whatever he wanted. </p>
            <p>I had previously wondered at Russiaâ€™s lack of colonial ambitions during the 17th through 19th century, but these books offered an antidote to that conception. Russia had Siberia, which resembled traditional colonialism in many ways. Extraordinary distances were travelled, native peoples were subdued and Christianized (in this case for the Orthodox Church) and made slaves, wars were fought, and folk heroes were made. Reid makes this case explicitly in places, but it bears a resemblance to the American West. Siberia was opened up before Russia had access to the Baltic Sea, which shows how weakened the empire was coming out of the rule of the Mongols in the 15th century. Despite what ultimately looks like a missed opportunity in many ways, the sheer richness of Siberia allowed Russia to absorb that mismanagement and grow into a formidable power. Siberia allowed Russia to control trade routes from China and Mongolia, along which a portion of the Silk Road traversed, and over which many luxury goods were carried that were highly coveted by European Russians and others across the Urals. The tea from this trading route also became a staple of Siberian diets. Frazierâ€™s account of his time in Siberia detailed unending dinnerâ€™s that consisted of cup after cup of tea decanted from a samovar that was never turned off. The Siberians he met loved to converse and philosophize over tea. Perhaps this is where the Russian novel gets its bent toward the abstract, meaty topics of philosophy, not to mention their typical length. </p>
            <p>I think the main points or questions Iâ€™m left with after beginning my reading journey through Siberia are:</p>
            <p>1.	The political economy of the place â€“ how it compares to other colonial regions of this time; what the particular effects of the tsarist regime were on the development of Siberia â€“ especially vis a vis America where there was not such top down command; how the prisoner population altered the trajectory of its identity, especially as compared to another famous penal colony, Australia; and how dealings with native populations differed from in other places both then and even today.</p>
            <p>2.	It seems there is very little recorded about the native people prior to Russian contact. Surely there would be other accounts by, for example, the Chinese in the Amur region. But the people in the remotest portions of Siberia seem to only have oral tradition to pass on. This is probably similar to the case of American Indians, but it still is one of my biggest curiosities. </p>
            <p>3.	Thereâ€™s kind of a big gap in literature on this topic, Iâ€™m assuming because of the Soviet Unionâ€™s regime for most of the 20th century. But most of the references in these books are from the 18th and 19th century by foreign expeditions.</p>
            <p>4.	Frazier is a kind of typical yuppie in his attitude, but you canâ€™t deny his tenacity for his subject when you listen to the rigors of Russian language instruction he went through and the quite often very uncomfortable conditions he endured as he traversed Siberia. Heâ€™s like an overachieving friend who can at times annoy you but you stick with because he really is very interesting. Hartley comes off like a young professor who has all the facts but fears offending anybody in her writing, and her book shows it. And Reid has the stance of a disillusioned leftist who is whip smart but is predominantly nihilistic in her worldview. She has a devil-may-care panache that lures you in, but when you arrive at your destination you get the feeling that her main goal was to make you feel like a hypocrite. All of which is to say: style matters. Reidâ€™s book will stay with me the longest, I think, if only because I have a bent towards a guilty conscience and the overall tone of her work spoke to that part of me. </p>
            <p>Frazierâ€™s book was good, but it would probably benefit from a bit of a closer reading of a physical copy. (Also, did you know that in the year 2002 a sable stole at Saks Fifth Avenue could cost $80,000 and a full coat $250,000?!) Hartleyâ€™s book is a good reference for dates and facts but nothing more. And Reidâ€™s book was my favorite of the three if only because she wields her pen like a shiv and is able to suddenly eviscerate you when you least expect it. </p>
