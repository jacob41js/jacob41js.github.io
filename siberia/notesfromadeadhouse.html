         <!-- Personal Reflections -->

            <h2>Personal Reflections</h2>
                <p>Speaking of DNFs, for the first time in a long time (maybe ever?) I have encountered a book that made me want to quit not because it was poorly written or pointless, but because the images it presented of human suffering and cruelty were so vivid and depressing that I did not want to read on. Despite this I slogged through Daniel Beers The House of the Dead, and firmly decided that was interests me most about this vast subcontinent is not the way it was used as a “prison without a roof” by the several regimes that exiled and tortured criminals over centuries, but instead the beauty and mystery it hides when humans are busy meddling in it and destroying it. That’s not to say that Beer’s book isn’t good or worth reading. It certainly is, and it’s accomplishment is in the way that it helps you see the continuity in an outlook towards those who do not fit into society that began half a millennia ago in Russia. Beer traces a genealogy of punishment from the 1500s through the 1900s that eventually makes the Soviet gulag system seem overdetermined, even though he devotes but a few paragraphs to it at the end of the book. And it leaves you seriously wondering whether there was ever an alternative path available.</p> 
                <p>From the banishment of the bell of Uglich, the tsars used exile to Siberia for two main purposes. First, obviously, as a means of punishing criminals. And from the earliest time this included both those guilty of crimes against the public (robbery, murder, etc.0 and political crimes. Before Siberia was opened up punishment for crimes was meted out in a variety of nasty ways: the knout (a particularly violent series of whips attached to a brass ring that could literally kill a person with only a handful of stokes); having ones nostrils ripped out; and, more mercifully, capital punishment. But once Siberia opened and the tsars saw its potential, this became a preferred method of punishment for the second reason: to colonize the vast subcontinent that had fallen into the Russian empire’s lap. That’s not to say that corporal punishment ended with exile. Convicts still had half their heads shaved, were branded, were forced to walk continental distances on foot through the mires of Siberian summer and fatally cold winters, were whipped with the knout or the birch rod, forced to run the gauntlet (which was a way to flagellate the convicts using dozens of wardens armed with a whip). And those were only the direct forms. Indirectly the prisoners faced squalor, disease, and hunger in waystations and prisons that killed just as easily. It’s little wonder that by the time these exiles reached Siberia, regardless of their true disposition on conviction, they were thoroughly corrupted in body and mind.</p>
                <p>Individuals surely suffered immensely, but their stories are for the most part forgotten to history, their corpses buried in shallow graves, burned, or, in some cases, laid beneath a road bed that their fellow prisoners were constructing at the time. Much of Beer’s thesis, though, begins with perhaps the most famous Siberian exiles, the Decembrists. Because what I think he tries to do over the following eleven chapters is make the case that the seeds of Russia’s revolution were sowed in Siberia. In refusing to deal with political challenges at home and instead banishing them to the remotest corners of the empire, the tsar allowed the ideas to foment in the minds of the prisoners and their sympathizers until the point they exploded. The Decembrists were the first large group of political challengers to face exile and capture the Russian imagination. Though their coup attempt was a comedy of errors that spectacularly failed, what they and their wives – who often voluntarily joined them in exile – while in Siberia became legendary. Many were sent to the mines in Nerchinsk, but because they were all nobles, their working conditions were actually not intolerable compared to common prisoners. This allowed them time to pursue scholarly endeavors and correspond with others, even though no more three Decembrists were allowed to settle in one location at a time. Throughout their banishment the Decembrists on the whole seem to have maintained their noble dispositions and did not become radicalized, perhaps reinforcing their standing in the Russian public consciousness. There were other groups to come though, like the Sibiriacy, Polish republicans who were exiled for rising against the tsarist control of Poland. Many were sent to Siberia under Tsar Nicholas I. And further into the future Russians who wanted more extreme change than the Decembrists could have dreamed of. These prisoners were treated increasingly poorly, and they began to have a negative impact on the citizens of Siberia who were virtually unprotected against brigands en route from European Russia to their final penal destination, prisoners who were settled in towns but were entirely destitute and uncontrollable, and escapees who roved the countryside trying to stay alive. The Russian far east became a kind of American Wild West (at least the popular image of it) where redistributive justice by private citizens became the law of the land.</p>
                <p>As prisoners piled up, it became more and more difficult to deal with the numbers and people were banished to even more remote locations like Sakhalin Island, a virtually uninhabitable land in the Pacific that was split between Russia and Japan. Despite all warnings the tsar pushed ahead with its use as a penal colony, and it seems it turned into a Lord of the Flies kind of situation. Chekov visited the island and reported on the unimaginable cruelty and destitution present. Eventually the island was abandoned after Russia lost its war with Japan. This was also the point at which the system – the whole thing, the tsar and the exile method of punishment – began to implode. Russia was losing pace with the rest of the world in terms of development, and a lot of that could be laid at the feet of not developing Siberia in any significant way. Perhaps they didn’t realize that the large proportion of prisoners was stifling growth, but the building of the Trans-Siberian railway was meant to begin to correct this problem. Ironically, this also made exile a lot less terrible, because it removed the necessity of making the journey by foot. This also opened up communication channels to the far east, and people at home and abroad became acquainted with the horrific tales of exiles’ lives in Siberia. As evidenced by Lenin’s stint in exile, Siberia became a hot bed of revolution, and eventually contributed greatly to the downfall of the tsar.</p>
                <p>Reading this in tandem with Plato’s Crito actually turned out to be a bit serendipitous. One of the main goals of that dialogue is Socrates’s argument for why he must accept his punishment even though all his friends know he is innocent. While reading this book, I couldn’t stop wondering what Socrates would think about a regime and a justice system like Imperial Russia’s, and whether he would accept that a prisoner of that system would be justified in fighting back or trying to escape. Does non-violent resistance work under such a system, or does is something more extreme necessary? It’s just really difficult to imagine the immense human suffering the prisoners of Siberia went through and then conclude the best recourse is the peaceful resistance of the citizenry. Not only does Beer’s book make me doubt the effectiveness of that strategy on the side of the prisoners, but it also makes me skeptical of the ability of a public to do that, much less one that allowed this system to be erected in the first place. At what point do we, as citizens of a nation, give assent to the laws governing a nation, and can that ever be revoked to the point that we decline to obey the laws while still living there? As a personal matter I believe really firmly in the rule of law and the idea that we should be very careful and skeptical about disobeying the law ever, because the whole of civilization rests on the foundation of the laws having a firm footing amongst the citizenry. But I never had a loved one utterly trampled beneath the boot of the state, much less been the victim of that myself. And so while I don’t advocate violence, when you look at the details of the terror a state can inflict, be it Siberian exile, slavery in the United States, the rule of a theocratic dictator, or communist authoritarians, it is not surprising that violence is what we get. A person of rare constitution can protest non-violently against such conditions – and there were of examples of this in the book. But how much more uncommon must be the person who can not only practice the resistance herself but inspire a critical mass of others to follow suit? Couple that with the violent birth of the Russian empire, emerging after suffering years of terror under the rule of Genghis Khan’s Mongols, a system that left little room for peaceful resolution of issues and that was the poster child of the rule of the strongest. People rightly expect change in these kinds of situations immediately, they are not interested in the long arc of history. For all any of those prisoners knew their role in such a hypothetical protest would have left them as a mere metaphorical brick in a long road stretching over decades or centuries, very similar to the way their physical bodies were treated. Perhaps all you can really take solace in is the hope for eternal life, to surrender completely to God and give up the temporal world, much like Dostoevsky following his exile. And again, while I might advocate this personally, I can hear how unconvincing and pat it sounds to the ears of a convict who is marching his way to another round of whippings with the knout, or trudging once again to the lightless mines of the far east, with nothing on the horizon to provide solace. It’s a shame and a sin what we do to our fellow human beings, all in the name of power and “justice”. </p>
