            <h2>Personal Reflections</h2>
            <p>Is this the first work to put on trial the theory of divine command morality – i.e. are things good (or pious) because the gods (or God) likes them, or do the gods (or God) like things because they are inherently good? We actually come a far way from the initial question offered up by this dialogue, namely whether Euthyphro is acting piously by prosecuting his father for the murder of a servant. I don’t think we ever come to a decision about whether that specific act is pious or not, because we come to the much larger question just mentioned, and another just as difficult: what exactly is “piety” anyway? </p>
            <p>On the divine command theory of morality, we get ourselves tangled up quite a bit due to the nature of the Greek pantheon of gods. For us in the Christian West, this is not something to easily stumble over (although I’m sure there are ways to – perhaps one way is to pit the God of the Old Testament against Jesus Christ of the New Testament, but that’s another discussion), but for the Greeks how exactly was one to make sense of the gods who were constantly depicted as squabbling over the affairs of mortals, betraying questionable morals, and being out-and-out untrustworthy and duplicitous? I’m aware of no specific descriptions of how believers in the polytheistic cult of Zeus and the Pantheon of gods were supposed to conduct their lives aside from giving sacrifice and hoping for the best. Maybe no dogma was available to these pagans with regards to modeling your life after the gods. But it obviously leads you to this difficult place where you cannot definitively give an account of what is pious (or good, beautiful, honorable, etc.) because if the ultimate board of appeals is the gods above, they clearly have not decided amongst themselves. Homer seems to have been somewhat of an ur-text for the Greeks, playing a similar role in their lives and institutions that the Bible does for us today. His Iliad and Odyssey are rife with battles between the gods, the gods giving themselves over to petty grievances, and the gods essentially inhabiting a morality of might makes right. Obviously this was an option that was available to the Greeks of Socrates’ day, and he even argues against this in several dialogues (not the least of which Republic). So the question becomes why doesn’t Euthyphro just go with this answer? To make up the details to provide an illustration, why doesn’t Euthyphro just say something like, “Athena is the god of justice, and despite her actions and the stories that have come down about her, the majority of people (or maybe her oracle) indicate that piety to her be accomplished in this way – prosecuting my father even though it transgresses the honor due to a father.” That to me seems like it’s a viable route to go down, and at least may take you farther than saying there is a particular piety common to all the gods. Perhaps piety in that case would become more of a situationalist ethic, where you have to do the correct action for the correct god at the correct time in order for something to be pious. All that said, that does not refute the difficulty underlying everything here which is that piety and every other virtue becomes relativistic, a conclusion Socrates would not accept. </p>
            <p>The discussion in this way leads the interlocutors to presage a bit Plato’s (if not Socrates’s) theory of forms, which is fleshed out in later dialogues but basically insists that for each thing in the universe there is a universal form of which it is part, but not fully it. So piety done by humans is only a copy of the Form of Piety that is unchangeable and the benchmark against which all “pious” things are measured. This dialogue does not get into that deeply, but once you know Plato’s theory of forms I suspect you see it everywhere in his dialogues. </p>
            <p>The second difficulty of what exactly is piety anyway turns on Socrates’s penchant for analogies to concrete examples used to illustrate abstract points of philosophy. Here we are treated to an explanation of how every act that we do has an end pointed towards some good. So a carpenter is working toward the good of building a house, a cobbler towards making a shoe, and, more relevantly, a horse trainer to the upbringing of a horse. Euthyphro insists that piety is some good that we do for the gods. He steps right into Socrates’s trap, because the easy follow up here is, if the gods are omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, then what good could we, as mere mortals, possibly do for them? Here again the ins and outs of Greek paganism probably could shed some more light on this, but when you get down to brass tacks, it is a valid question because if we humans can actually do some good for the gods, what business do we have worshipping and following them anyway? Christianity I think avoids this problem because the reason given to follow God’s commands is not to benefit God, per se, but because he wants what is best for us out of an infinite and all-abiding Love, and the only way to hope to achieve that is by aligning our will to His. There is nothing we can add or subtract from God (although I suppose you could ask wouldn’t God be upset if we don’t choose Him and, consequently, Love? But maybe that’s a problem for another day). And perhaps Socrates’s accusers can see where this line of questioning is heading. Socrates never says he doesn’t believe in the gods (or God) but if you start teasing apart what the elites say they believe about those same gods, and you begin to uncover things that contradict that understanding, then you are probably a heretic, which for all intents and purposes labels you as an unbeliever. </p>
            <p>There are many other interesting aspects to this dialogue. Something tells me there is something literary going on between Euthyphro’s prosecution of his father as compared to Zeus overthrowing his father Kronos. Knowing what comes next, the Apology, it’s easy to see, too, the allusions to that dialogue, especially with respect to the charge that Socrates denies the existence of the gods or even proposes new gods and is thereby corrupting the youth. What is Plato doing here in Euthyphro? Is he merely pointing out that the people looked to the most as religious authorities are not as wise as they say they are, or is he giving a defense of Socrates obliquely, showing that the charge is on its face ridiculous since not even those appointed to know about the gods really know anything? Or is he subtly trying to undermine the system entirely, using Socrates as a mouthpiece to aim a devastating critique of the Greek pantheon? I suppose there is a Straussian read of this that is something along those lines. But as a work of great literature and philosophy, I can definitely say that this dialogue is rewarding a second, third, or even fourth time around. </p>
